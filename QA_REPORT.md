However, several critical components need attention before production deployment, particularly in the areas of security, content moderation, and error handling. By addressing the priority action items identified in this report, the platform will be better positioned for a successful launch.

The development team should focus on completing the critical and high-priority items before setting a launch date, while medium-priority items can be addressed in the immediate post-launch period.

## Next Steps

1. Create tickets for all identified issues in the project management system
2. Prioritize the critical items for immediate development
3. Schedule a security audit with an external consultant
4. Conduct user testing with a focus on creator experience
5. Develop a phased rollout plan to minimize risk
